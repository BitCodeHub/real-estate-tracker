# ✅ Fixed: Undefined Address Issue

## What Was Fixed
The issue where adding "4598 Calderwood Street, Las Vegas, NV 89103-4320" resulted in "undefined" showing in the address column has been resolved.

## Key Changes
1. **Better Address Parsing**: Now handles addresses with ZIP+4 format (89103-4320)
2. **Newline Handling**: Converts newlines to commas when pasting multi-line addresses
3. **Multiple Fallbacks**: If parsing fails, uses the original address instead of "undefined"
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to help troubleshoot parsing issues

## How to Test
1. Click **"+ Add Property"**
2. Enter the address: `4598 Calderwood Street, Las Vegas, NV 89103-4320`
3. Click **"🔍 Analyze Property"**
4. Click **"✅ Add to Portfolio"**
5. The address should now display correctly in the table

## Supported Address Formats
- ✅ `123 Main St, Las Vegas, NV 89103`
- ✅ `123 Main St, Las Vegas, NV 89103-4320`
- ✅ `123 Main St` (on one line) + `Las Vegas, NV 89103` (on next line when pasted)
- ✅ `123 Main St Las Vegas, NV 89103`

## If You Still See "undefined"
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Address Parsing Debug:" messages
3. The last property can be manually fixed:
```javascript
properties[properties.length - 1].address = "Your Address Here";
renderTable();
```

The fix has been pushed to GitHub and will be included when you deploy to Render.com.
