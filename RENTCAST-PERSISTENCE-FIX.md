# RentCast Data Persistence Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Data Loss on Reload**: RentCast API data was not persisting after page reload
2. **Incorrect Field Mapping**: Some RentCast fields were being stored in JSONB instead of proper database columns
3. **Server Override**: Server data was overriding newer local RentCast data on reload
4. **Field Name Inconsistencies**: Frontend used different field names (beds/baths/sqft) than database (bedrooms/bathrooms/square_footage)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Load Logic (index.html)
- Modified `loadProperties()` to preserve newer RentCast data from localStorage
- Added timestamp comparison to determine which data is more recent
- Server properties are loaded first, then merged with local properties
- If local property has newer RentCast data (based on lastUpdated), it's preserved

### 2. Improved Save Logic (index.html)
- Added comprehensive logging in `refreshSingleProperty()`
- Enhanced `saveProperties()` to preserve RentCast data when updating server
- Added verification step after saving to ensure data persists

### 3. Database Field Mapping (db.js)
- Fixed `updateProperty()` to correctly separate fields between regular columns and JSONB
- Added field mapping to handle naming variations:
  - beds → bedrooms
  - baths → bathrooms
  - sqft → square_footage
  - yearBuilt → year_built
  - currentValue → value_estimate
  - lastUpdated → last_updated
- Removed duplicate fields from JSONB that belong in regular columns

### 4. Server Response Handling (server.js)
- Added logging to track RentCast data expansion
- Ensured JSONB fields are properly merged in GET responses
- Added logging in PUT endpoint to track updates

### 5. Create Property Enhancement (db.js)
- Added normalization logic to handle field name variations
- Ensures consistent field mapping regardless of input format

## Testing Tool

Created `test-rentcast-persistence.html` to debug and verify the fixes:
- Check localStorage contents
- Check server properties
- Simulate RentCast updates
- Test reload behavior with detailed logging

## How It Works Now

1. **Fetching RentCast Data**: When refresh button is clicked:
   - Data is fetched from RentCast API
   - Property is updated with all RentCast fields
   - `lastUpdated` timestamp is set
   - Data is saved to both localStorage and server

2. **Saving to Server**: 
   - Regular fields (beds, baths, etc.) go to database columns
   - Extra RentCast fields (pool, garage, etc.) go to JSONB
   - Server preserves the data structure

3. **Loading on Reload**:
   - Server properties are loaded first
   - Local properties are checked for newer RentCast data
   - If local has newer data, it overrides server data
   - Merged result is saved back to localStorage

## Verification Steps

1. Open the main app and refresh a property's data
2. Check console for confirmation logs
3. Reload the page
4. Verify the RentCast data is still present
5. Use test tool at `/test-rentcast-persistence.html` for detailed debugging

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend (index.html)
- Enhanced merge logic in `loadProperties()`
- Added comprehensive logging
- Improved timestamp comparison
- Better handling of server responses

### Backend (db.js)
- Fixed field mapping for consistent naming
- Separated regular columns from JSONB data
- Added normalization for create and update operations

### Server (server.js)
- Added debug logging
- Ensured proper JSONB expansion

The persistence issue should now be fully resolved with RentCast data properly saved and restored across page reloads.
