# UI Simplification - Button Removal

## Changes Made

The Real Estate Investment Tracker UI has been simplified by removing all buttons except for the "Add Property" button.

### Buttons Removed:
1. **Analyze Property** - Used to analyze a new property without adding it
2. **Market Overview** - Generated market insights based on existing properties
3. **AI Market Insights** - Generated AI-powered market analysis
4. **Add Test Property** - Added a test property for development/testing

### What Remains:
- **Add Property** button - The primary function for adding new properties to track

### Technical Changes:
- Removed button elements from the header (lines 1002-1013 in index.html)
- Commented out the `addTestProperty()` function (lines 4653-4691)
- Modal elements remain in the DOM to prevent breaking any existing references
- All related functions remain intact but are no longer accessible via UI buttons

### Result:
The application now has a cleaner, more focused interface with just the essential "Add Property" functionality prominently displayed in the header.
