# üîç Finding and Fixing All 17 Properties

## The Issue
You have 17 properties in your portfolio, but the app is only showing 2 properties in the counter and none in the table.

## Quick Fix

Open the app and then open your browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
findAll17Properties()
```

This will:
1. Search all browser storage locations (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB)
2. Find all property data wherever it's stored
3. Load all 17 properties into the table
4. Update the property counter
5. Save them properly for future use

## What This Function Does

The `findAll17Properties()` function searches:
- Global JavaScript variables
- All localStorage keys
- All sessionStorage keys
- IndexedDB database
- Window object properties

It looks for any data that looks like property objects (has address, price, or rent fields).

## Auto-Detection

The app now automatically detects when only 2 properties are loaded instead of more, and will run the search automatically on page load.

## If Properties Still Don't Show

1. **Check Browser Console for Errors**
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Check what the function found

2. **Force Reload from Storage**
   ```javascript
   emergencyShowProperties()
   ```

3. **Manual Fix**
   ```javascript
   fixPropertiesNow()
   ```

4. **Check Current State**
   ```javascript
   console.log(properties)
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('properties'))
   ```

## Preventing Future Issues

The app now:
- Automatically detects missing properties
- Searches all storage locations on startup
- Shows detailed console logs for debugging
- Auto-fixes common issues

If you continue to have issues with properties not showing, the console logs will help identify where the data is stored.
