# Performance Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chart Display Issues ✅
**Problem**: "Cash Flow by Property" and "ROI Comparison" charts were displaying with excessive height, causing lots of scrolling.

**Solution**:
- Set fixed heights for chart containers (400px on desktop, 300px on mobile)
- Limited canvas max-height to 350px (250px on mobile)
- Added `maintainAspectRatio: false` to prevent height expansion

### 2. Slow Loading Performance ✅
**Problem**: App loaded very slowly, especially with many properties.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Disabled Chart Animations**: Set `animation: false` in chart options
- **Limited Chart Data**: Show only top 20 properties by ROI when more exist
- **Shortened Labels**: Truncate property addresses to 15 characters
- **Debounced Updates**: Chart updates delayed by 100ms to prevent excessive redraws
- **Loading Indicator**: Added visual feedback during initial load
- **Update Method**: Using `update('none')` to skip animation frames

### 3. Chart Rendering Optimization ✅
- Reduced Y-axis ticks with `maxTicksLimit`
- Optimized interaction modes for better responsiveness
- Rotated X-axis labels for better space utilization

## CSS Changes
```css
.chart-card {
    height: 400px;
    position: relative;
}

.chart-card canvas {
    max-height: 350px !important;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .chart-card {
        height: 300px;
    }
    .chart-card canvas {
        max-height: 250px !important;
    }
}
```

## JavaScript Optimizations
- Replaced all direct `updateCharts()` calls with `debouncedUpdateCharts()`
- Charts limited to 20 properties maximum
- Animations completely disabled
- Loading indicator shows during initial page load

## Results
- Charts now display at reasonable fixed heights
- No more excessive scrolling
- Significantly faster page load
- Smooth chart updates without animation lag
- Better performance with large datasets

## Testing
1. Refresh the page - should see loading indicator
2. Charts should appear at fixed heights without scrolling
3. Add/edit properties - charts update smoothly
4. Page should load much faster than before
