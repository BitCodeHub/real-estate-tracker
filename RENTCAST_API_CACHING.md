# RentCast API Caching Strategy

## Overview
The Real Estate Investment Tracker now implements smart caching for RentCast API calls to minimize unnecessary API usage and improve performance.

## Key Changes

### 1. No Automatic API Calls on App Load
- The app no longer makes RentCast API calls when loading existing properties
- Properties are loaded from the database/localStorage without fetching fresh market data
- This prevents API rate limiting and reduces loading time

### 2. API Calls Only When Needed

#### When API Calls ARE Made:
1. **Manual Refresh**: When user clicks the refresh icon (üîÑ) on a property
2. **New Property Addition**: When adding a single property via the form
   - API data is fetched once and cached with the property

#### When API Calls are NOT Made:
1. **App Startup/Reload**: No automatic API refresh
2. **Bulk Import**: CSV/Excel imports skip API calls entirely
3. **Property Analysis**: The "Analyze Property" feature shows basic analysis without API data

### 3. Caching Implementation

Each property now includes a `rentcastCache` field:
```javascript
property.rentcastCache = {
    data: { /* Full RentCast API response */ },
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    success: true
}
```

### 4. Visual Indicators

The refresh icon (üîÑ) shows different states:
- **Yellow/Warning Color**: No RentCast data cached yet
- **Default Color**: Has cached data (hover shows last update date)

Additional indicators:
- üìä Green icon: RentCast data available
- ‚ùå Red icon: No RentCast data

### 5. User Experience Improvements

#### Bulk Import:
- Properties are imported quickly without API delays
- Users are notified to refresh individual properties for market data
- No more 500ms delays between imports

#### Property Analysis:
- Shows basic property analysis instantly
- Provides option to add the property if user wants full data
- No automatic API calls during analysis

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Usage**: Dramatically fewer API calls, especially for users with many properties
2. **Faster Performance**: No waiting for API responses on app load
3. **Better Control**: Users decide when to refresh data
4. **Cost Savings**: Lower API usage means lower costs
5. **Reliability**: App works even if RentCast API is down or rate-limited

## How to Use

1. **View Cached Data**: Properties display their last known values
2. **Refresh Data**: Click the üîÑ icon on any property to fetch latest market data
3. **Bulk Import**: Upload CSV/Excel files quickly, then selectively refresh important properties
4. **New Properties**: Single property additions still fetch data automatically for convenience

## Technical Details

- Cache is stored with each property in the database
- Cache timestamp tracks when data was last fetched
- Full API response is preserved for future use
- Properties work with or without cached data
