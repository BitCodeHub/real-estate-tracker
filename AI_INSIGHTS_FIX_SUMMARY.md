# AI Market Insights Fix Summary

## Problem
The "AI Market Insights" button was generating the error "Error generating AI insights. Please try again." when clicked.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when trying to call the Gemini API directly from the browser. Modern browsers block direct API calls to external domains for security reasons.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Proxy
- Added a new endpoint `/api/ai-analysis` to `server.js` that acts as a proxy
- The server makes the API call to Gemini, avoiding CORS issues
- The endpoint accepts a POST request with the prompt and returns the AI analysis

### 2. Updated Client Code
- Modified the `generateAIInsights` function in `index.html` to call the server proxy instead of the Gemini API directly
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages and troubleshooting tips
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Error Display
- Shows specific error messages to help users understand what went wrong
- Provides troubleshooting tips in the UI when errors occur
- Logs detailed error information to the browser console

## Files Modified
1. **server.js** - Added `/api/ai-analysis` endpoint
2. **index.html** - Updated `generateAIInsights` function to use server proxy

## Files Created (for testing/debugging)
1. **debug-ai-insights.html** - Standalone test page for AI insights
2. **fix-ai-insights.js** - JavaScript patch file (can be used as alternative fix)
3. **server-ai-proxy.js** - Separate proxy module (not used, integrated into server.js)
4. **index-ai-fix.html** - Alternative fix implementation

## How to Test
1. Make sure the server is running: `npm start` or `node server.js`
2. Open the application at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Enter a property address (e.g., "123 Main St, Austin, TX 78701")
4. Click the "AI Market Insights" button
5. The AI analysis should now work properly

## Test Addresses
- 123 Main St, Austin, TX 78701
- 456 Oak Ave, Denver, CO 80202
- 789 Pine St, Seattle, WA 98101
- 321 Elm Dr, Miami, FL 33101

## Debugging
If issues persist:
1. Check server console for error messages
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console and Network tabs
3. Verify the Gemini API key is valid
4. Ensure you're accessing the app through http://localhost:3000 (not file://)

## API Key Configuration
The Gemini API key is currently hardcoded but can be configured via environment variable:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Additional Features Added
- Detailed error logging
- Server-side error handling
- Response validation
- Comprehensive error messages with troubleshooting tips
