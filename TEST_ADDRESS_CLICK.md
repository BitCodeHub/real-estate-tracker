# Test: Address-Only Click for Modal

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed** entire row click behavior
2. **Made only address clickable** - shows as underlined purple text
3. **Other cells remain editable** without triggering the modal
4. **Commented out old renderTable** function that had row click handler

## How to Test

1. Open `public/index.html` in your browser
2. Look at the property table:
   - Address column should be **purple and underlined**
   - Hovering over addresses shows pointer cursor
   - Click on any **address text** → Modal opens ✅
   - Click on any **other cell** → No modal, allows editing ✅
   - Click the **🔄 icon** next to address → Refreshes that property's data

## Visual Guide

```
✅ Clickable (opens modal):     ❌ Not clickable (allows editing):
│ 8205 Celina Hills St 🔄 │     │ Las Vegas │ NV │ 89131 │ 3 │ 2.5 │
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  (underlined, purple)             (normal text, editable cells)
```

## Troubleshooting

If the entire row is still clickable:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors

The address should appear as underlined purple text. If it doesn't, the CSS might be cached.
