# Sold Property Detection - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Visual Indicators
- **Red strikethrough text** on sold property addresses
- **Pink background** (#fee) for entire row of sold properties
- **"SOLD" badge** - red background with white text
- **Sale details** shown below address (date and price)
- **N/A display** for all financial metrics when sold

### 2. RentCast API Detection
Enhanced the `refreshSingleProperty` function to detect sold properties:
- Checks `lastSaleDate` within 365 days (increased from 180)
- Checks if sale price differs >3% from listing (reduced from 5%)
- Checks multiple status fields: `propertyStatus`, `listingStatus`, `status`
- Also checks raw data for any sold-related fields

### 3. UI Updates
- Modal shows special "Property Sold" analysis
- Alert notification when property detected as sold
- Sold properties show sale date and price difference
- Address is no longer clickable with purple underline (shows red strikethrough instead)

### 4. CSS Styling Added
```css
.property-sold { background-color: #fee !important; }
.property-sold td { color: #dc3545; opacity: 0.8; }
.address-sold { color: #dc3545 !important; text-decoration: line-through; font-weight: 600; }
.sold-badge { background: #dc3545; color: white; ... }
.sold-notice { background: #fee; border: 1px solid #dc3545; ... }
```

## How It Works

1. When user clicks refresh (ðŸ”„) on any property
2. System fetches data from RentCast API
3. Checks multiple fields for sold status
4. If sold, marks property with `isSold = true`
5. Stores `soldDate` and `soldPrice`
6. Table re-renders with red styling
7. Alert shows sale information

## Testing

Use the test commands in `test-sold-property.html` to manually test the feature:
```javascript
properties[0].isSold = true;
properties[0].soldDate = new Date().toISOString();
properties[0].soldPrice = 485000;
renderTable();
```
