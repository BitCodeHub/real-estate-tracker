# RentCast API Comprehensive Enhancement

## Overview
The Real Estate Tracker now fetches comprehensive property data from RentCast.io API including market values, detailed property information, neighborhood statistics, and more.

## UI Improvements

### 1. Fixed API Status Indicator
- **Previous Issue**: "RentCast API Connect" text was overlapping content in bottom left
- **Solution**: Redesigned and moved to top right with:
  - Smaller, cleaner design with backdrop blur
  - Click to collapse/expand functionality
  - Animated pulse indicators (green for connected, red for disconnected)
  - Shorter text labels ("RentCast Connected" vs "RentCast Not Setup")
