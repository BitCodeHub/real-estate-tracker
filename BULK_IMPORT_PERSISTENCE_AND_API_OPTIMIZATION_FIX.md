# Fix for Bulk Import Persistence and RentCast API Optimization

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bulk Imported Properties Disappearing After Reload
**Problem**: Properties imported from Excel files were not persisting after app reload.

**Cause**: When properties already existed in the database but weren't loaded in the current session, the bulk import would skip them without loading them into the local array.

**Solution**: Modified bulk import to load existing properties from the database when they're detected as duplicates:
```javascript
// If property already exists, load it from database
if (data.propertyId) {
    const existingPropResponse = await fetch(`/api/properties/${data.propertyId}`);
    // Add to local array if not already there
}
```

### 2. Multiple RentCast API Calls on Refresh (3 instead of 1)
**Problem**: Clicking the refresh icon was making 3 API calls:
1. `/api/rentcast/properties`
2. `/api/rentcast/rent-estimate`
3. `/api/rentcast/value-estimate`

**Cause**: The code was checking for rent/value data but then fetching it anyway, even when the properties endpoint already provided it.

**Solution**: Major optimization to trust the properties endpoint data:
```javascript
// MAJOR OPTIMIZATION: Don't fetch additional data if properties endpoint provided it
const needsRent = false; // Properties endpoint usually has rent data
const needsValue = false; // Properties endpoint usually has value data
const needsMarket = false; // Skip market stats entirely

// Only fetch if absolutely necessary (rare case)
if (!property.rent && !property.rentRangeLow && !property.price && !property.priceRangeLow) {
    // Fetch rent estimate only as fallback
    rentData = await fetchRentEstimate(address);
}
```

## Code Changes

### 1. Bulk Import Enhancement (index.html)
- When a property already exists (409 response), fetch it from the database
- Add it to the local properties array if not already present
- This ensures all properties are visible after import

### 2. RentCast API Optimization (index.html)
- Changed default for `needsRent` and `needsValue` to `false`
- Properties endpoint typically includes all necessary data
- Only make additional API calls if ALL data is missing (rare)
- Reduced from 3 guaranteed calls to 1 call in most cases

## Testing

1. **Bulk Import Persistence**:
   - Upload an Excel file with properties
   - Note which properties already exist
   - Reload the app
   - All properties (new and existing) should be visible

2. **API Call Reduction**:
   - Click refresh icon on any property
   - Check browser console for "Total RentCast API calls made:"
   - Should show 1 call instead of 3
   - Check console for "Property data contains:" to see what data was returned

## Benefits

1. **Data Persistence**: All properties (imported and existing) remain visible after reload
2. **API Cost Savings**: 66% reduction in API calls (from 3 to 1)
3. **Faster Performance**: Single API call means faster refresh
4. **Better UX**: Properties don't disappear mysteriously

## Console Debugging

Look for these messages:
- "üì• Loaded existing property from database: [address]"
- "üîç Property data contains: {rentFields: {...}, valueFields: {...}}"
- "üìä Total RentCast API calls made: 1"
