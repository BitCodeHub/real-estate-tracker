# Property Persistence Fix Verification

## Issues Fixed

1. **Properties not persisting after reload**
   - Fixed ID assignment after creating properties in database
   - Properties array now properly updated with server response
   - localStorage synced after all saves complete

2. **Deleted properties reappearing**
   - `deleteProperty` now calls DELETE API endpoint
   - Only removes from local array if database delete succeeds

3. **Field mapping issues**
   - Fixed snake_case to camelCase field mapping
   - Server data always takes priority over localStorage

## How to Test

### Test 1: Property Persistence
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Add a new property using the "Add Property" button
3. Note the property appears in the table
4. **Reload the page** (Cmd+R or F5)
5. ‚úÖ The property should still be there

### Test 2: Property Deletion
1. Click on a property in the table
2. Click "Delete" in the property details modal
3. Confirm the deletion
4. **Reload the page**
5. ‚úÖ The property should remain deleted

### Test 3: Check Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `‚úÖ Loaded X properties from server and synced to localStorage`
- `‚úÖ Property created with ID: X`
- `üóëÔ∏è Deleting property X from database...`
- `‚úÖ Property deleted from database`

## Diagnostic Tools

1. **Quick Diagnosis**: Open `/diagnose-sync.html`
   - Shows database vs localStorage comparison
   - Run tests to add/delete properties
   - Check for sync issues

2. **Step-by-Step Test**: Open `/test-sync-issue.html`
   - Simulates the exact add/reload/delete cycle
   - Shows detailed logs of what's happening

3. **Verify Fix**: Open `/verify-fix.html`
   - Quick verification of the fixes
   - Shows current state of database and localStorage

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
   Then reload the page.

2. Check server logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f server.log
   ```

3. Check browser console for errors

The fixes ensure that:
- Properties get proper IDs when created
- IDs are saved to localStorage after creation
- Deletes go through the API, not just local removal
- Server data is properly mapped to UI fields
