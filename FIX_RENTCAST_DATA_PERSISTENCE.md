# Fix: RentCast Data Persistence

## Problem
When refreshing live data from RentCast API, the comprehensive property data (features, market stats, construction details, etc.) was not being saved to the database. When the app reloaded, all real-time data was lost, requiring unnecessary API calls.

## Root Cause
The database schema only had specific columns for basic property data, but RentCast provides much more comprehensive information including:
- Property features (pool, fireplace, garage, etc.)
- Construction details (foundation, roof type, architectural style)
- Owner information
- Market statistics and trends
- Value/rent ranges and confidence scores
- Historical sale data

This additional data was being stored in JavaScript memory but not persisted to the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update
Created a migration to add a JSONB column `rentcast_data` to store all additional property data:
```sql
ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rentcast_data JSONB;
```

### 2. Server-Side Changes

#### Updated `db.js`:
- Modified `createProperty` to extract and store RentCast-specific data in the JSONB column
- Modified `updateProperty` to merge new RentCast data with existing data
- Both functions now separate regular fields from RentCast-specific fields

#### Updated `server.js`:
- All property endpoints now merge the JSONB data back into the response
- When fetching properties, the `rentcast_data` is expanded and merged with main properties
- This ensures the client receives all data as a flat object structure

### 3. Client-Side Changes

#### Updated `index.html`:
- Modified `saveProperties` function to accept an optional property index
- When a specific property is updated (like during refresh), it now updates that property on the server
- The `refreshSingleProperty` function now calls `saveProperties(index)` to persist RentCast data

## How It Works Now

1. **When adding a new property with RentCast data:**
   - All comprehensive data is sent to the server
   - Server separates basic fields (stored in columns) from extra data (stored in JSONB)
   - Property is saved with all data preserved

2. **When refreshing property data:**
   - RentCast API is called to get latest data
   - Property is updated with all new data
   - `saveProperties(index)` is called to update the specific property on the server
   - All data is persisted in the database

3. **When loading properties:**
   - Server fetches properties from database
   - JSONB data is merged back into each property object
   - Client receives complete property data including all RentCast information

## Testing the Fix

1. **Apply the database migration:**
   ```bash
   node apply-migration.js
   ```
   Or manually run the SQL in `migration-add-rentcast-data.sql`

2. **Test data persistence:**
   - Add a property and analyze it with RentCast
   - Refresh the property to get live data
   - Reload the page
   - Verify all RentCast data is still present (features, market stats, etc.)

3. **Check the property detail modal:**
   - Click on a property
   - Verify all sections show data:
     - Property Features
     - Construction Details
     - Owner Information
     - Market Analysis
     - Tax Assessment
     - Market Statistics

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls:** RentCast data is persisted, reducing unnecessary API calls
2. **Better Performance:** Data loads instantly from the database
3. **Data History:** Can track how property data changes over time
4. **Offline Capability:** Properties show full details even without internet
5. **Cost Savings:** Fewer API calls means lower RentCast API usage costs

## Future Enhancements

1. Add a "last synced" timestamp display for each property
2. Implement automatic refresh scheduling (e.g., weekly updates)
3. Add data change tracking to see how estimates change over time
4. Create data export functionality including all RentCast data
