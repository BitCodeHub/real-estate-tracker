# Mobile Display Fix - No Properties Showing

## Problem Identified
The properties weren't displaying on mobile because the `loadProperties()` function was never called when the page loads. The statistics showed data existed, but the properties array was never populated.

## Fix Applied
Added initialization code that runs when the DOM is loaded:
- Calls `loadProperties()` to fetch data from server/localStorage
- Updates mobile property cards if on mobile view
- Handles window resize events to switch between mobile/desktop views

## Code Changes
Added to `/public/index.html` (line 7022):
```javascript
// Initialize application on page load
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
    console.log('🚀 Initializing Real Estate Tracker...');
    
    try {
        // Load properties from server/localStorage
        await loadProperties();
        console.log('✅ Properties loaded:', properties.length);
        
        // Update mobile property cards if on mobile
        if (window.innerWidth <= 768) {
            updateMobilePropertyCards();
            console.log('📱 Mobile property cards updated');
        }
        
        // Handle window resize
        let resizeTimer;
        window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
            clearTimeout(resizeTimer);
            resizeTimer = setTimeout(() => {
                updateDisplay();
                updateMobilePropertyCards();
            }, 250);
        });
        
        console.log('✅ Initialization complete');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ Error during initialization:', error);
    }
});
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

2. **Check browser console**
   - You should see: "🚀 Initializing Real Estate Tracker..."
   - Followed by: "✅ Properties loaded: 11"
   - And on mobile: "📱 Mobile property cards updated"

3. **Debug if needed**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Paste the contents of `debug-mobile-display.js`
   - This will show if properties are loaded and attempt to fix

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Properties now load automatically when page opens
- ✅ Mobile property cards display correctly
- ✅ Responsive switching between mobile/desktop views
- ✅ Hamburger menu continues to work as before

## Notes
- The statistics were showing because they might have been cached or calculated differently
- The actual properties array wasn't being populated on page load
- This is why the mobile view showed "No Properties Yet" despite having data
