# Sold Property Detection Feature

## Overview
The Real Estate Tracker now automatically detects and marks properties that have been sold, displaying them with red text and a "SOLD" badge to indicate no further research is needed.

## How It Works

### 1. Detection from RentCast API
When you refresh a property's data, the system checks for:
- **Last Sale Date**: If the property sold within the last 365 days
- **Price Difference**: If the sale price differs from listing by >3%
- **Status Fields**: If RentCast marks the property as "SOLD"

### 2. Visual Indicators
Sold properties are displayed with:
- **Red strikethrough text** for the address
- **Red "SOLD" badge** next to the address
- **Pink background** for the entire row
- **Sale details** (date and price) shown below the address
- **N/A** for all financial metrics (CF, CoC, etc.)

### 3. Property Modal
When viewing a sold property's details:
- Title shows "SOLD" badge
- Special AI analysis explains the property is no longer available
- Shows sale date and price
- Recommends removing from watchlist

### 4. Alert Notification
When a property is detected as sold during refresh:
- Alert shows sale date and price
- Notifies that no further research is needed

## Testing the Feature

1. Click the ðŸ”„ refresh icon next to any property
2. If RentCast returns sale data, the property will be marked as sold
3. The row will turn red with strikethrough text
4. Financial metrics will show as N/A

## Manual Testing (for development)
To manually test the sold property display, you can temporarily mark a property as sold in the browser console:
```javascript
properties[0].isSold = true;
properties[0].soldDate = new Date().toISOString();
properties[0].soldPrice = 450000;
renderTable();
```

## Benefits
- **Saves Time**: No need to research sold properties
- **Clear Visual Cue**: Red text immediately shows property is unavailable
- **Automatic Detection**: Updates when refreshing property data
- **Historical Data**: Shows when and for how much the property sold
