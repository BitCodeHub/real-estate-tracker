# RentCast Data Debug Instructions

## The Issue
The app is making only 1 API call (good!) but Est. Value and Rent Est. are still missing. This means RentCast is returning these fields with different names than expected.

## What I've Fixed
1. Added comprehensive field analysis logging
2. Made the app smarter - it will make a second call ONLY if the first call doesn't return rent/value data
3. Added server-side logging to see raw RentCast responses

## How to Debug

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)
1. Open your app in the browser
2. Open the console (F12)
3. Copy and paste this command:
```javascript
fetch('/quick-rentcast-test.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
```
4. Wait 3 seconds for the results
5. Look for the "Possible RENT field" and "Possible VALUE field" entries

### Option 2: Manual Check
1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Click the refresh icon on any property
3. Look for these log entries:
   - `🚨 FIELD ANALYSIS` - Shows potential rent/value fields
   - `💰 Possible RENT field:` - Fields that might contain rent
   - `🏠 Possible VALUE field:` - Fields that might contain value
   - `📊 Data from properties endpoint:` - Shows if data was found

### Option 3: Check Server Logs
1. Look at your server console
2. You'll see `🚨 RENTCAST API RESPONSE ANALYSIS:`
3. This shows the exact fields RentCast is returning

## What to Look For

You need to identify:
1. **The field name for rent estimate** (might be: rentEstimate, rent, monthlyRent, rentAmount, etc.)
2. **The field name for value estimate** (might be: value, price, estimatedValue, marketValue, etc.)

## Share the Results

Once you run the test, please share:
1. The console output showing "Possible RENT field" entries
2. The console output showing "Possible VALUE field" entries
3. Any field names that look like they contain rent or value data

## Example Output
```
💰 Possible RENT field: rentAmount = 2500
💰 Possible RENT field: estimatedMonthlyRent = 2500
🏠 Possible VALUE field: propertyValue = 450000
🏠 Possible VALUE field: marketEstimate = 450000
```

With this information, I can update the code to use the correct field names!
